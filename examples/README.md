# Python BT82x Development Examples

[Back](../README.md)

## Runnable Examples

In the example code the `apprunner` and `bteve2` libraries are imported. A function is made which takes a parameter called `eve` which is used to access the BT82x. At the top level of python script a call is made to `apprunner` with the name of the function. This sets up the environment for drawing on the BT82x.

The following example code is available:

## Widgets and Utilities

In addition to runable demo code there are libraries of widgets and utilities that are used by the examples or help development.

| File/Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [snippets](snippets/README.md) | Common files and widgets for the examples |

Many of the examples load code or modules from this directory. 

TODO: this directory will be split into widgets and utilities.
