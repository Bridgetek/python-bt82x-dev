# Python BT82x Development Examples

[Back](../README.md)

## Runnable Examples

In the example code the `apprunner` and `bteve2` libraries are imported. A function is made which takes a parameter called `eve` which is used to access the BT82x. At the top level of python script a call is made to `apprunner` with the name of the function. This sets up the environment for drawing on the BT82x.

The following example code is available:

| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [simple](simple/README.md) | Simple example code |
| [fontmagic](fontmagic/README.md)fontmagic.py | Simple example code demonstrating scaling and rotating fonts |
| [segment](segment/README.md)segment.py | Simple seven segment demo code |
| [b2tf](b2tf/README.md)b2tf.py | Advanced seven segment demo code |
| [teapot](teapot/README.md).py | 3D teapot rotation demo code |
| [plottest](plottest/README.md) | Simple plot graph demo code |
| [audioloop](audioloop/README.md) | Advanced plot graph widget demo |
| TODO: bitmap-split-merge.py | Simple bitmap split/merge demo code |
| TODO: bitmap-crop.py | Simple bitmap crop demo code |
| TODO: tsd.py | Time-series data live display, using HISTOGRAM |

## Widgets and Utilities

In addition to runable demo code there are libraries of widgets and utilities that are used by the examples or help development.

| File/Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [common](common/README.md) | Common files and widgets for the examples |

Many of the examples load code or modules from this directory. 

TODO: this directory will be split into widgets and utilities.
